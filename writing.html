                                <p><b><span style="font-size: 16px;">The Doctor–Patient Dialogue Is Productive</span></b></p>
                                <p>Depending on whom you ask, the doctor–patient dialogue is either as productive as it's ever been or broken beyond easy repair.</p>
                                <p>From rising costs and time constraints to omnipresent and potentially conversation-disrupting electronic health records and smartphones, more barriers separate doctors and patients than ever before. But no matter what drives the two parties apart — or how technology threatens to supplant their conversations — face-to-face dialogue between doctors and patients remains a cornerstone of the practice of medicine. And despite all the potential limiting factors, that dialogue remains both productive and essential.</p>
                                <p>Don't buy it? Think back a decade or three, when patients weren't so much a part of the decision-making process — as, by all rational accounts, they are today — as they were passive recipients of the advice and information conveyed by the all-knowing physician. Indeed, doctors and patients believe that the added complexity of the healthcare system and the readier availability of information have served to elevate their conversations.</p>
                                <p>“There are many obstacles in the way of the doctor– patient relationship, but for the most part it is still a sacred, trusted bond,” says Dr. Linda Girgis, a family practitioner who has been in private practice since 2001. “We just have to work at keeping it that way. We are moving from a paternalistic ‘doctor knows best' model to one where doctors and patients are a team.”</p>
                                <p>Along those lines, patients believe the weight of their input has grown. “Doctors are having a more in-depth dialogue with patients,” says Jackie Zimmerman, the founder and executive director of advocacy group Girls With Guts. “Now there's more information, and doctors are more likely to speak to patients as a person.” </p>
                                <p>MarlaJan Wexler, a nurse who also has lupus and an advocate who blogs at LuckFupus.com, agrees that the doctor–patient dialogue has become more of a two-way street, especially when compared to a decade ago. “In the past, you pretty much went to your doctors and they said, ‘Take this pill and this test.' Now we want to know why we are taking this pill and what this test is going to show — and if it shows something, where we go from there,” she explains. “It's a whole new experience, because [doctors] are actually listening to what we have to say, rather than just looking at the results of our tests.”</p>
                                <p>That communication has improved, in large part, since patients began arming themselves with information in advance of doctor visits. “I'm a more-educated patient. I take it upon myself to know what I want to ask when I walk into an appointment and I think doctors respect that we have a more efficient conversation,” Zimmerman says.</p>
                                <p>Wexler agrees, adding that “patients are more in tune with their own health and how medications and foods affect them.”</p>
                                <p>This has not escaped their doctors' notice, according to Dr. Gwendolyn Reyes, a pediatrician at the Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan. “Everything gets discussed in a little more detail. There are a lot more people using Google,” she explains. “There are definitely deeper conversations on side effects and benefits.”</p>
                                <p>We've reached a point where some doctors expect patients to perform background research before appointments. A SERMO poll of its online physician community found that 22% of U.S. millennial doctors (defined as doctors born after 1982) expect patients to conduct some degree of research before they step into the doctor's office. </p>
                                <p><b><span style="font-size: 16px;">The Doctor–Patient Dialogue Is Broken</span></b></p>
                                <p>Without a doubt, the increasing availability of health and medical information has helped usher in the era of the “empowered patient.” But according to practitioners and patients alike, it hasn't raised the bar for their conversations.</p>
                                <p>Despite arming themselves with reams of information, many patients aren't getting what they want — or need — from their doctor visits. The likely culprits? Time constraints, distracting technology, and misplaced anger about healthcare costs.</p>
                                <p>A recent study funded by Novartis found that while both sides agree on the importance of the doctor–patient dialogue, that agreement doesn't always translate into productive conversations. The researchers polled women with metastatic breast cancer and found that while 89% of patients and 76% of oncologists surveyed believe it is important to discuss long-term treatment plans, 43% of patients reported they never had this discussion.</p>
                                <p>The reason for that may be as simple as a lack of time, according to Wexler. “There's such a crunch. You wait four or five hours for a doctor and then when you get in, you have 10 to 12 minutes. That's not enough time,” she says.</p>
                                <p>The time crunch means that patients must come prepared for their appointments — which can be a double-edged sword. </p>
                                <p>“Patients who go out of their way to educate themselves are having more productive conversations,” Zimmerman reports. “But some doctors expect all patients to be heavy-Googling people and not all of them are. And those patients may be getting a lower-level quality of conversation because doctors assume they already know what they're talking about.” </p>
                                <p>Wexler notes the potential danger in relying on health information found on the web. “We talk about ‘Google University' and how easy it is to research things, but that information is not always reputable,” she explains. “My parents didn't grow up with Google, so they might not be as willing or able to do the research or the work that it takes to learn about a disease.”</p>
                                <p>The furor over cost of care has also bled into the doctor's office, according to Dr. Girgis.</p>
                                <p>“Patients are getting angry about insurance issues, about having to pay more money and receive fewer services from insurance companies,” she says. “A lot of times it's the doctor who tells them this news — ‘your test is not covered.' The anger gets directed toward the doctor.”</p>
                                <p>The all-EHRs-all-the-time mandate can similarly impede productive conversations between doctor and patient. “I understand [physicians] have to take notes, but I've had full conversations with doctors where they were taking notes the whole time,” Zimmerman says.</p>
                                <p>At the same time, Wexler believes that a doctor's age can play a part in how attentive he or she is while managing EHRs during consultations. “Sometimes physicians, especially ones from older generations who are used to paper charts, get hyper-focused on documenting things. Their heads are in their keyboards. You wonder how much information they're actually absorbing,” she laments.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Reyes points out, however, that EHR preoccupation is a problem that spans generations. “Body language is a tool of communication,” she says. “Doctors can get so focused on using the computer that they aren't necessarily sitting down with patients. That can make [those doctors] come across as less empathetic.”</p>

        How a new device can record and transmit the symptoms of Parkinson's disease

                                 <small>Read on <a href = "http://www.mmm-online.com/parkinsons-disease-klick-health-device/article/652217/" target="_blank" >MM&M</a>.</small>
                                <p>Nothing prepares you for the sheer misery you feel when watching a loved one slowly succumb to a neurologic disorder like Parkinson's disease. I should know: I watched my grandmother battle with it for more than two decades until it finally took her life. </p>
                                <p>During that time, I felt like I understood the disease. I could trace the disease's subtle progress more in what she couldn't do than what she could. While I could see her hands shaking and noticed her off-balance gait, I more easily understood the toll of the disease when she wasn't able to do the little things that she loved, like pick me up from school or cook for me and my grandpa.</p>
                                <p>Last week I met with Yan Fossat, &nbsp;VP of Klick Labs, who showed me a new wearable armband developed by Klick Labs that can record and play back the tremors felt by a Parkinson's disease patient. I came to the meeting armed with the preconception that no device could help me better understand the symptoms that I had witnessed the impact of for so many years. </p>
                                <p>I was not ready for what actually happened. The electrodes in the armband shocked my forearm repeatedly, my muscles contracting to the point where the experience quickly shifted from uncomfortable to somewhat painful. </p>
                                <p>I tried to pick up my mobile phone — an automatic motion I do more than I care to admit — and, finally, after a painstaking few minutes of working to get it into a normal position in my hand, I realized I had no shot at ever getting it past the lockscreen. In that moment, I felt as though I understood the impossibility of the disease — in losing control over your own body, and the very real frustration of being unable to complete even the simplest of tasks.</p>
                                <p>That kind of understanding is the driving force behind the device, which is known as the SymPulse, said Fossat. “We started it really as a thought experiment,” he said “Could we create empathy for Parkinson's disease patients?”</p>
                                <p>The SymPulse works by converting muscle spasms into data through the use of an electromyogram, a device that measures the electrical activity of muscles. It can then transmit that information wirelessly through Bluetooth to an armband with electrodes that can then mimic tremors and muscle contractions. </p>
                                <p>“We can digitize the muscle spasm using the electromyogram and transmit them to the caregiver, and then using electrical muscle stimulation make their muscle contract in the same way as the patient,” Fossat explained. </p>
                                <p>Klick Labs, the innovation research center of Klick Health, a healthcare agency, developed the device. </p>
                                <p>The importance of empathy in the clinical setting is still being understood. Some research posits that when physicians better understand what their patients are going through, those patients have better outcomes according to one 2012 study. The research, published in Academic Medicine, found that patients of physicians with high empathy scores had a significantly lower rate of complications, leading researchers to conclude that physician empathy “should be considered an important component of clinical competence.”</p>
                                <p>There are signs, too, that empathy is a skill sorely needed among physicians. One clinical trial, also conducted in 2012, that studied empathy levels in physicians and residents at Massachusetts General Hospital, found that 53% of physicians reported that their empathy for patients had declined over the past several years, while only 33% reported an increase in empathy for their patients. </p>
                                <p>Fossat said that a device like SymPulse could eventually be used in a whole range of diseases. “You can imagine using telemedicine across the planet, where if you have a patient with a rare form of a disease, They could transmit the symptoms to a specialist somewhere else and they could make a diagnosis with way more accuracy than just asking questions or looking through a video,” he said.</p>

          Drugmakers set their sights on the next potential blockbuster disease: NASH

                                <small>Read on <a href = "http://www.mmm-online.com/icpt-gild-gnft-nash/article/525780/" target="_blank">MM&M</a>.</small>
                                <p>With at least 20 global Phase-II clinical trials, blockbuster sales estimates, and millions of prospective patients, the market for NASH, or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, is viewed in many ways as one of the largest potential categories for new drugs in recent years.</p>
                                <p>The NASH market, currently with no approved treatments, is already <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/15/the-next-hepatitis-c-nash.html">drawing comparisons</a> <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/15/the-next-hepatitis-c-nash.html">from analysts </a>to other diseases with lucrative new drugs like hepatitis C.</p>
                                <p>Last week, Allergan in less than 12 hours announced the acquisition of two companies developing NASH therapies — Tobira Therapeutics and Akarna Therapeutics. Allergan isn't the first large drugmaker to join this race. Gilead Sciences, Merck, AstraZeneca, and Novo Nordisk are all currently developing NASH drugs.</p>
                                <p>NASH is the manifestation of obesity in the liver, said Dr. Leon Henderson-MacLennan, co-founder and medical consultant for the inThought Research Group. The disease is tied to metabolic syndrome, which includes conditions like high blood pressure and excess body fat. While cardiovascular disease, also common in obese patients, targets hearts and arteries and diabetes affects the pancreas, NASH threatens the liver.</p>
                                <p>“You're seeing the effects of this scourge of obesity in this country,” Henderson-MacLennan &nbsp;explained. “We're consuming too many calories, eating the wrong food stuffs, and essentially intoxicating ourselves.”</p>
                                <p>The cause of NASH is not well understood by physicians but risk factors for the disease include obesity, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
                                <p>inThought estimates that there are between 10 and 15 million million patients in the U.S. with this disease, and that between one-fifth and one-fourth of those people are at risk for cirrhosis, or chronic liver damage. NASH is expected to be the leading cause of liver transplants within the next five years and is currently the second leading cause of liver transplants, according to a <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/848198_4">study </a>in <i>Gastroenterology</i>. The precursor to NASH, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, affects <a href="http://www.liverfoundation.org/abouttheliver/info/nafld/">one in four people in the United States, according to the American Liver Foundation.</a></p>
                                <p>Alethia Young, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, believes that the patient population is slightly smaller, estimating that about 6.5 million adults in the U.S. and the five largest European countries have advanced NASH, according to an analyst note from July 2014. She estimates that the peak market for NASH medicines will be between $35 billion and $40 billion by 2025. Allergan said that the current NASH market is worth near $8 billion.</p>
                                <p>One reason for the lofty estimates is because the disease is tied to obesity. The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the morbidly obese population has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2674744/">estimated</a> to be as high 92%, according to <i>the Journal of Lipid Research</i>.</p>
                                <p><b>LEADING TREATMENT CANDIDATES</b></p>
                                <p>Another similarity between the NASH and HCV markets is that, again, biotechnology firms are leading the charge in developing new treatments. “The pace has been set by smaller, nimbler companies,” Henderson said.</p>
                                <p>New York-based Intercept Pharmaceuticals is considered by two experts interviewed for this story to have the candidate furthest along in development: obeticholic acid.</p>
                                <p>Obeticholic acid (OCA), currently in a Phase-III trial, is a modified version of a compound in the liver called a bile acid. Bile acids are used by the body to help with digestion as well as liver function.</p>
                                <p>Intercept plans to conduct an interim analysis a year and a half after the trial's start date, which was September 2015. The company has said it expects that analysis to form its application to the FDA. The drug received a Breakthrough Therapy designation in January 2015.</p>
                                <p>OCA may also benefit from already being tested in real-world settings. The drug was cleared by the FDA's accelerated approval program in May to treat primary biliary cholangitis, a rare liver disease, as Ocaliva. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Intercept's primary competition is another biotech, the French manufacturer Genfit, which is developing elafibranor. Elafibranor is thought to play a role in liver acid transport and anti-inflammatory activities inside the body.</p>
                                <p>The company announced in March that it had enrolled its first patient in a Phase-III trial for elafibranor and said it expects to fully enroll the trial by the beginning of next year. The company believes elafibranor should be on track for a potential launch by the second half of 2019.</p>
                                <p>Right now, Henderson said he's “more impressed” with Intercept's program and there will likely be a “greater degree of comfort” among physicians prescribing OCA &nbsp;since it has already received approval in another indication.</p>
                                <p>“There's a clear path forward for this agent,” he said. “It's looking at a nice sample size in the trial and with good enrollment at the time.”</p>
                                <p>Of the 10 million to 15 million U.S. patients that his firm estimates have NASH, he said that 80% to 90% of that patient population would be eligible for OCA barring any significant adverse events.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Amit Dhawan, medical director for Kantar Health, also sees Intercept as the current leader in development. But he points out that Gilead Sciences, which brought to market Harvoni and Sovaldi, the game-changing hepatitis-C treatments, has been very involved in this field. Gilead has a strong background in liver sciences with its HCV franchise and already has relationships with hepatologists.</p>
                                <p>“They have multiple shots on goal,” Dhawan said, referring to the multiple products Gilead can offer liver specialists and adding that “they have products that are somewhat far along.”</p>
                                <p>Gilead is currently developing simtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody designed to treat the effects of NASH, cirrhosis, and advanced liver fibrosis, rather than treating the disease itself. The drugmaker is currently investigating five different drugs for the disease.</p>
                                <p>If any of the drugs in development are approved to treat NASH, Henderson said that drugmakers should target hepatologists, endocrinologists, and primary-care physicians. Disease awareness campaigns would also be prudent for this new class of drugs in order to alert prescribers about potential new treatment options.</p>
                                <p>“All three [types of physicians] need to be addressed quickly: the hepatologists due to the specter of cirrhosis; the endocrinologist because you're going to have to administer these agents with oral hypoglycemics and insulin; and primary care physician because they will oversee a patient's entire treatment plan,” Henderson said.</p>
                                <p><b>MARKET UNCERTAINTIES</b></p>
                                <p>The size of the prospective population, the breadth of agents in clinical development, and analysts' lofty market estimates paint a rosy picture of the market potential for NASH therapies, but there are a number of risk factors that could send these drugs' billion-dollar sales estimates off the rails. &nbsp;</p>
                                <p>For one, the emergence of payers in prescribing decisions puts a lot of uncertainty in the market, lest one forgets the last time a compelling drug for a liver disease with an $84,000 price tag became available — in this case, it was Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi — and these drugs are not proven cures, like Sovaldi is. &nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Craig Mattson, senior director of clinical programs for pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics, said the company is “very concerned” about the potential cost implications of treating this disease. So much so that Prime is currently discouraging off-label use of Intercept's OCA by requiring prior authorization before a patient can start taking the drug as a NASH treatment. He also said the company is currently waiting for more data from Intercept's Phase-III program, and other programs as well, to determine how it will eventually cover these drugs for its clients if approved by the FDA.</p>
                                <p>Payers may also be reluctant to cover potentially expensive medications, in part because lifestyle changes are often the first-line treatment for this disease. Doctors often recommend patients first work to reduce their overall cholesterol levels, exercise more frequently, and better control their diabetes — if that's a factor.</p>
                                <p>Another hurdle for drugmakers will be diagnosis. NASH is known as the “silent killer,” because patients don't experience symptoms during the early stages of the disease and the only way to confirm a diagnosis for NASH is through a liver biopsy, which is an invasive procedure. Those factors may not only limit the number of patients who could receive treatment but could also hinder current enrollment for large Phase-III clinical trials.</p>
                                <p>Both Henderson and Dhawan said they expect drug developers to work toward developing new techniques to identify the disease in patients. “The type of [biomarker] does not have to be proprietary necessarily, it could be an imaging diagnostic — whether that's ultrasound or MRI imaging,” Henderson said. &nbsp;</p>

                                <p>In many ways, diabetes seems like an ideal case for the cognitive computing power of Watson.</p>
<p>“In diabetes especially, you're always interested in food and activity,” Kathy McGroddy-Goetz, VP of partnerships and solutions for IBM Watson Health, <a href="http://www.mmm-online.com/technology/watson-health-partners-with-drug-and-devicemakers-to-tap-into-real-world-data/article/490930/">told</a> <i>MM&M</i> as part of the magazine's Watson Week coverage earlier this year. </p>
<p>“It's a disease where so much happens between visits to the doctors,” McGroddy-Goetz said. One of the proposed applications of a recent partnership with the American Diabetes Association is a personal diabetes “adviser,” powered by Watson, designed to fill those treatment gaps.</p>
<p>Another goal of the ADA–Watson alliance, which the two struck in June, is to convey information to healthcare providers in smarter ways. </p>
<p>“There's an overwhelming amount of information,” laments Jane Chiang, the ADA's SVP of innovation. </p>
<p><b>THE CUTTING EDGE</b></p>
<p>“We're good at disseminating cutting-edge research — we have journals and meetings that do that — but it's hard for providers to stay on top of it,” Chiang continues. “The goal of working with IBM Watson is to use its machine-learning capabilities to provide information fairly rapidly to the healthcare provider so that it can inform clinical decision-making — more effective and accurate diabetes management.”</p>
<p>The organization is armed with content, a vast professional and consumer network, and a brand. It just lacked a clear way to disseminate its information in a manner that resonated with its target audience. </p>
<p>“We needed to partner with a leader in technology to get that information out,” Chiang recalls.</p>
<p>The ADA is also sitting on a rich repository of data, and Watson will be trained to understand it. After ingesting the association's 66 years' worth of clinical and research data, Watson, which understands questions posed in natural language, will strive to create evidence-based, confidence-ranked recommendations for a range of health decisions. </p>
<p>“Although IBM is very traditional, it was doing innovative things — population health, personalized goals,” Chiang stresses. “It's not just gathering information. It's doing something with that information.”</p>
<p>The ADA hopes Watson can help ease the day-to-day burden of people with diabetes. “We realized that we're not as nimble as we could be,” Chiang says. “Our leadership realized that the technology arena is something we needed to enter and make a full commitment to.”</p>
<p>It's the latest example of experimentation in diabetes, where drugmakers, support organizations, and startups are experimenting with solutions that leverage technology to help manage this insidious and largely asymptomatic disease.</p>
<p>And the stakes have never been higher. Four hundred thousand seniors are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes every year, 27% of people 65 and older already suffer from diabetes, and an additional 50% have prediabetes, according to a trend report from the Institute of Alternative Futures.</p>
<p><b>ENABLING BETTER BEHAVIORS</b></p>
<p>Yet for all the strides made in the treatment of diabetes — recent advances include the approval of Sanofi's daily GLP-1 Adlyxin in July and Novo Nordisk's long-acting insulin Tresiba last September — patients are struggling to keep pace. Globally, nearly 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes are not taking their medications as prescribed, according to <i>Diabetic Medicine</i>. <i>Diabetes Care</i>, on the other hand, notes that the disease cost the U.S. health system alone $176 billion in 2012 — and, per <i>Population Health Management</i>, that figure is expected to rise to more than $622 billion by 2030. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists diabetes as the seventh-leading cause of death in the U.S. </p>
<p>For HCPs, researchers, patients, and caregivers, Watson can help generate tailored treatment approaches, find hidden data patterns, and customize information that can lead to healthier behavior. In what other ways are stakeholders driving toward better diabetes outcomes?</p>
<p>For Graham Goodrich, VP of diabetes marketing for Boehringer Ingelheim, the first step toward driving better behaviors is through the creation of accessible educational materials.</p>
<p>“We have to find ways of taking complex data from our prescribing information and boil it down to something digestible and usable,” Goodrich admits. “Our scientific communications and legalese do not meet the needs of an average patient. Yes, we write to an eighth-grade level, but that doesn't go far enough. Everyone is digesting 140-character tweets, not essays. We have to adjust our information delivery.” </p>
<p>Goodrich's thoughts are echoed in Improving Type 2 Diabetes Therapy Adherence and Persistence in the U.S., a recent IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics report in which IMS recommends tying educational materials to patients' needs, which it characterizes as one of the “most effective interventions ... in order to avoid providing information [that] is not adapted to an individual's level of health knowledge or self-management skills.”</p>
<p>Goodrich clearly agrees, adding that technology “affords us the opportunity to package that educational information in a way that really resonates and promotes understanding in a way that's empowering. The next step is once [somebody has] learned something, how do we keep it top of mind?”</p>
<p>One of the ways BI hopes to keep patients engaged is through “edutainment.” Goodrich says the drugmaker plans to leverage its past work with HealthPrize, a technology company that provides gamified support programs. BI launched its first gamified effort in June for another chronic disease, COPD (the company manufactures Spiriva Respimat, a prescription inhaler for COPD). Respipoints, as it's called, is a free online program that gives users points for taking their medicine, reading educational materials, and refilling their prescriptions. They can then redeem those earned points for rewards, like gift cards.</p>
<p>That kind of investment could soon prove fruitful for BI. In June, an FDA advisory panel voted in favor of allowing the drugmaker to claim that its diabetes medicine Jardiance reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke. The agency is not required to follow the panel's recommendation but often does. </p>
<p>Education, of course, wasn't a one-way street before the internet era and certainly isn't one now. That's why the industry, alongside technology companies and their health-tech partners, has come to the realization that connecting patients to certified diabetes educators can sow trust and help reinforce healthy behaviors. And that begins with better communications. </p>
<p><b>A PERSONAL TOUCH</b></p>
<p>“When you're talking to your endocrinologist, you have about six or seven minutes,” Goodrich says. “When your doctor asks, ‘Do you have any questions?' the questions usually aren't top of mind. They come during the drive home or when you're cooking.” </p>
<p>That insight led BI to invest in certified diabetes educators (CDEs) — and BI is not alone. Sanofi has a similar program, COACH, which offers what Rachele Berria, head of the company's diabetes medical unit in the U.S., describes as “tailored educational information and tools for people living with diabetes once they are prescribed one of our treatments.”</p>
<p>CDEs, pharma, and technology companies can strike the right balance between personal touch and more formal reinforcement of a physician's advice. “Diabetes is very complex. People are not going to change because of technology alone,” explains David Weingard, CEO of Fit4D, a provider of web-based diabetes-coaching platforms. “People change because they're motivated by other people. Technology is the medium that enables scale. When [patients] know their coach, they'll text their coach.”</p>
<p>Goodrich agrees that the foundation of effective coaching is trust. “When people are finding relevant, valuable, and helpful information, it builds loyalty and trust,” he says. “The whole concept behind our current DTC campaign for Jardiance is that when life gets in the way, you have a backup buddy. Patients want someone to help them.”</p>

          Pfizer and Allergan merger to create uncertainty for agencies, execs say

                                <small>Read on <a href = "http://www.prweek.com/article/1377662/pfizer-allergan-merger-create-uncertainty-agencies-execs-say" target ="_blank">PRWeek</a>.</small>
                                <p class="p2">When Pfizer announced plans to acquire Allergan for $160 billion, the first questions to surface had to do with the feasibility of the deal. What are the tax implications? What would a combined Pfizer-Allergan look like?&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1"> The deal not only creates the world's largest drugmaker but also one of the world's largest advertisers. Combined Pfizer and Allergan spent a total of $1.6 billion on advertising in 2014, according to Kantar Media. &nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p2">At stake are the fates of the drugmakers' massive brand budgets for drugs like Viagra, Celebrex, Botox and Juvederm, to name a few. There remains a lot of uncertainty about which agencies will be left outside looking in and which firms will be awarded potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in new billings when the dust clears, according to agency executives interviewed for this story.</p>
                                <p class="p1">An unnamed executive at an independent healthcare agency said the merger will likely lead to a consolidation of marketing agencies. “It's not a matter of if, but when,” he said. “They have to figure out how profound a disruption do they want?”</p>
                                <p class="p1">Pfizer is already the seventh largest advertiser in the US, according to Kantar Media data cited by <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-and-allergan-deal-creates-advertising-behemoth-1448307132"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a>. Globally, in 2014 Pfizer spent $1.4 billion on advertising; Allergan spent $266 million; and Actavis, which acquired Allergan in November 2014 and took the drugmaker's name, spent $387 million, according to Kantar Media. In comparison, Procter & Gamble—the world's largest advertiser in 2014—spent $4.6 billion.</p>
                                <p class="p1">From January to June of this year, Pfizer spent $740 million while Allergan spent $144 million. Actavis spent $261 million in the same timeframe.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1">The same agency executive noted, however, that it's unlikely any significant changes to the drugmakers' agency rosters will occur prior to September 2016. The deal is expected to close by the end of next year.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1">Pfizer currently works with a global network of WPP creative agencies known as “Team Pfizer.” Team Pfizer is made up of more than 100 regionally based offices in 33 countries and works on more than 35 Pfizer brands. Pfizer is one of WPP's largest clients.</p>
                                <p class="p1">WPP will not be alone, though, in wondering if Team Pfizer awaits a review of the business. At least 26 healthcare advertising agencies could stand to be affected by the deal, according to agency-supplied information published in the <i>MM&M </i>2015 Agency issue. Nineteen companies listed Pfizer as one of their healthcare accounts, and another seven agencies listed Allergan as a healthcare account.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1">Those twenty-six agencies span four agency networks: Omnicom, WPP, Interpublic Group and Publicis Groupe.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1">Pfizer declined to discuss future marketing plans. Allergan did not respond to inquiries by press time.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1">The CEO of a major agency network said his biggest fear is simply an overall slowdown in marketing spending. “Mergers and acquisitions create uncertainty,” he said, noting that he doesn't anticipate many changes in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p2">“I can be nervous because there's change,” the same executive added, with the caveat: “We have pretty solid relationships.”</p>
                                <p class="p1">In order to wade through that uncertainty, it's helpful to look at Pfizer's last megadeal—the acquisition of Wyeth in 2009—as a possible blueprint for how it may handle marketing divisions following the deal's closing.</p>
                                <p class="p1">Pfizer announced its acquisition of Wyeth in January 2009 and closed the deal in October the same year. From 2008 to 2009, Pfizer's advertising spend in professional healthcare journals dropped 22% from $47 million to $36 million, according to Kantar Media. Its spend did rebound somewhat the following year, rising 10% year-over-year to $40 million in 2010. &nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1">Five months after Pfizer finalized the deal to acquire Wyeth, it consolidated all of the media buying for Wyeth's DTC brands. The combined drugmaker eventually awarded an estimated $250 million in billings to Carat, <a href="http://adage.com/article/agency-news/advertising-carat-picks-work-pfizer/142707/">according to <i>Advertising Age</i></a>. An in-house division at Wyeth had previously had the business.</p>
                                <p class="p1">After another review in September 2010, Carat kept the business, noting at the time that it would continue to be Pfizer's AOR for DTC media planning and buying for its pharmaceutical business across all channels, <a href="http://adage.com/article/agency-news/carat-1-2-billion-pfizer-media-review/147791/"><i>Ad Age</i> reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1">If history is any indicator, in-house agencies employed by Allergan and Pfizer could face a review. One agency executive said: “Pfizer historically doesn't do in-house agencies.”&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1">Pacific Communications is an in-house agency for Allergan. Pacific Communications President Craig Sullivan said in an email that it's premature to comment on anything related to the merger, but that his shop “remains committed to supporting our Allergan clients.”</p>
                                <p class="p1">Pacific's website currently features work for Allergan brands Botox, Latisse and Lastacraft, a prescription eyedrop brand, as well as Valeant's Bausch & Lomb. &nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1">Pfizer may not find much fat to trim at Allergan, however, as the company already slimmed margins <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/valeant-takes-allergan-complaints-to-regulators-1405942770">last year</a> to fend off a hostile takeover by Valeant. David Pyott, Allergan's CEO at the time, devised a cost-savings plan as a way to appease investors before Valeant's takeover fell through and the company was ultimately acquired by Actavis.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1">Still, Allergan in 2015 launched <a href="http://www.mmm-online.com/pharmaceutical/allergan-debuts-actuallyshecan-campaign/article/427660/">“Actually She Can</a>,” an unbranded social media campaign. Herm Cukier, VP of women's healthcare for Allergan, described the initiative at the time as part of a long-term commitment to women: “This isn't just a three-month campaign. In five years I hope we'll look back and see that this a starting point to a more transformational approach.”</p>
                                <p class="p1">While Pfizer-Wyeth may hold a few clues as to how Pfizer-Allergan's marketing strategy may begin to take shape, its future plans may be complicated by the fact that Pfizer has already undergone a recent consolidation of its major brands.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="p1">In 2014 Pfizer completed a global creative review that concluded with that business being divvied up between three holding companies: WPP, Omnicom and Publicis. <i>Ad Age</i> reported at the time that the review was conducted through Pfizer's procurement department.</p>
